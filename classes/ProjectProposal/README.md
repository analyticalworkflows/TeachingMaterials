# Project Proposals

The primary goal in this course is for you to develop more efficient research skills.  An important secondary goal is to have you make significant progress on your thesis!  My philosophy is that we can achieve both because our primary goal will be best achieved by having you practice new tools while working on your own research (rather than on homework assignments, for example).

In order for me _and your classmates_ to support and help you, we need to know what your goals are for the quarter.  Hence these "Project Proposals".

### Required readings (_before class_)
_None_

### To do (_before class_)
- Create a slide presentation.  
- Use _no more than **5 slides**_ (including title slide)!
- Export slides to pdf.
- Send to Mark Novak (mark.novak@oregonstate.edu).

### Class structure
We'll dedicate the whole class period to presentations.

**Each presenter** will have **_6 minutes_** to:
1. summarize their background (e.g., prior experiences, reason for being in course);
2. summarize their project (i.e. the scientific issue being addressed);
3. summarize their project goals for the quarter (their workflow/project management goals rather than scientific goals);
4. summarize their anticipated challenges.

In putting your presentation together, think hard about your audience and what it is we need to (and don't necessarily need to) know.  Don't shy away from important or useful ideas, but also don't distract us from them.  Communication skills are (increasingly) key to being a successful scientist.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

Following each presentation there will be approximately 1 minute for comments from the group, while the next presenter is getting ready. Further feedback can be provided ad hoc during group discussions or outside of class. Acountibilibuddies will also provide each other feedback at the end of class, time allowing.


### Rubric
The rubric with which your presentation will be assessed is [here](../../course_info/rubrics/).

<b id="f1">1.</b> "Effective communication both within a collaborative team and to the broader scientific and nonscientific community is a critical skill in science. In both cases, researchers who are effective communicators learn to invest time and energy in understanding their audience—whether it is a research team or a policy-setting organization—and honing their skills to engage in a meaningful, respectful and productive dialogue."
