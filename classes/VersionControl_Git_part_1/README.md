# Git & Github - Part 1
In this class we'll discuss the basics of Git and GitHub:  _pull_, _create/edit_, _stage_, _commit_, _push_, and _repeat_.

### Required readings (_before class_)
- Notes: [tex/Intro2Git.pdf](tex/Intro2Git.pdf)
- [Getting Started - What is Git?](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)

### To do (_before class_)
- Install Git (see [Introduction](../Introduction/README.md))
- Create an account on [GitHub](https://github.com)

### Class structure
After finishing-up [Structuring Projects](../StructuredProjects/README.md), we'll use the remaining time for:
- Discussion - what is Git? what is Github?
- Exercise (see next section)
- (Re)starting your project's structure
- Setup of your project repository
- Troubleshooting

### Exercise during class
Working as one big group, with the instructor at the blackboard (or diagraming on the classroom computer), the instructor leads in doing the following challenge. **Draw a "box and arrow" diagram of a basic Git / Github workflow that has labels for the `following`: `local project files` on a computer in a `repository`, a `commit`, `push`, `fetch` (optional? `pull`, `branch`, `fork`) ** Then the instructor erases the diagram and each student draws their own (5-10 min). Then students can present their diagrams to the group for discussion, to surface any confusion or differences in interpretation, and to find good alternative ways of thinking about things that may 'click' for different people.
